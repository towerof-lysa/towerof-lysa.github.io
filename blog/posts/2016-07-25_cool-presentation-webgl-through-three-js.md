# Living in California is like...

<u>"California" - An Acrostic Poem:</u><br>
[Inspiration](http://www.movoto.com/guide/ca/moving-to-california/)

* <b>Casual Friday</b> - This is for everyday, everytime. Church attire? "Jesus wore sandals to church, why shouldn't you?"
* <b>Avocados</b> - On the short list of things some Californian's get excited about. The other is rain. We &hearts; our crops. 
* <b>L.A.</b> - It's just one city. With a ton of people. And a higher ratio of celebrities. A lot of people don't live there.
* <b>Ice Cream</b> - Because it's my favorite food. And we serve it in all shapes, types, and sizes.
* <b>Food</b> - In general, because it's really teriffic. 
* <b>Oceans</b> - We got some pretty nice beaches. 
* <b>Rush Hour(s)</b> - That moment when eight lane highways are not enough. 
* <b>NorCal vs. SoCal</b> - We're better together.
* <b>In-N-Out</b> - You knew this was coming. 
* <b>Astronomically High Cost of Living</b> - Relative, of course.

This is been poetry with 'Lysa.
