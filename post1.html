<h1>Wassup World?!</h1>
<h4>And Other Extreme Sports</h4>

Underneath these stairs

I hear the sneers and feel glares of

My cousin, my uncle and my aunt.

Can't believe how cruel they are

And it stings my lighting scar

To know that they'll never, ever give me what I want.

I know I don't deserve these

Stupid rules made by the Dursleys

Here on Privet drive.

Can't take all of these muggles,

But despite all of my struggles,

I'm still alive.

I’m sick of summer and this waiting around.

Man, its September, and I’m skipping this town

Hey, it’s no mystery,

There’s nothing here for me now

(He stands up.)

I got to get back to Hogwarts;

I got to get back to school.

Got to get myself to Hogwarts,

Where everybody knows I'm cool

Back to wizards and witches, and magical beasts,

To goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts.

It’s all that I love, and it's all that I need.

At HOGWARTS, HOGWARTS, I think I'm going back.

I'll see my friends, going to laugh 'til we cry

Take my Firebolt, going to take to the sky

NO WAY this year anyone's going to die,

And it's going to be totally awesome!

I'll cast some spells, with a flick of my wand

defeat the dark arts, yeah bring it on!

And do it all with my best friend Ron,

'Cause together we're totally awesome!
