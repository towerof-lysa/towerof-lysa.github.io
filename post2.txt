<h1>That's Right, And It's Gonna Be Totally Awesome</h1>
<h4>A Very Potter Musical</h4>
<br>



Ron : It's been so long, but we're going back

Don't go for work, don't go there for class

Harry: As long as were together-

Ron : -going to kick some grass

Harry & Ron : -And it’s going to be totally awesome!

This year we'll take everybody by storm,

Stay up all night, sneak out of our dorm-

(Hermione pops up behind them with a stern look on her face.)

Hermione Granger: But let's not forget that we need to perform well in class...

</div>

If we want to pass our OWLS!

Ron: (With a roll of the eyes) Aw, Hermione, why do you have to be such a buzzkill?

Hermione: Because, school’s not all about having fun. We need to study hard if we want to be good witches and wizards!

I may be frumpy, but I'm super smart

Check out my grades, they're "O’s" for a start

What I lack in looks, well, I make up in heart,

And well guys, yeah, that's totally awesome

This year I plan to study a lot-

Ron: That would be cool if you were actually hot!

Harry: Hey Ron, come on, we're the only friends that she's got!

Ron: And that's cool...

Hermione: And that's totally awesome!

Harry, Ron & Hermione: Yeah it's so cool, and it's totally awesome!

We're sick of summer and this waiting around!

It's like we're sitting in the lost and found!

Don't take no sorcery

For anyone to see how...

We got to get back to Hogwarts.

We got to get back to school.

We got to get back to Hogwarts,

Where everything is magic-cooooool!

Ensemble : Back to wizards and witches, and magical beasts

To goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts

It's all that I love, and it's all that I need at

HOGWARTS, HOGWARTS!
